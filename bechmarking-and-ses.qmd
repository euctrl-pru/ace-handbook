# ANSP benchmarking and the SES Performance Scheme

The objective of this chapter is to explain the main differences between the ACE financial cost-effectiveness indicator and the Single European Sky (SES) en-route cost-efficiency KPI (as defined in Regulation (EU) N°2019/317 [@eu2019/317]).

First of all, it should be noted that these two indicators have been specified in response to different needs:

-   The purpose of the ACE analysis is to benchmark the cost-effectiveness performance of ANSPs in providing gate-to-gate ATM/CNS services (where en-route and terminal ATM/CNS are considered together). The ACE financial cost-effectiveness indicator is computed as the ratio of ATM/CNS provision costs to composite flight-hours and it can be broken down into three components (ATCO-hour productivity, ATCO employment costs per ATCO-hour and unit support costs). These components allow interpreting the differences in cost-effectiveness performance observed across Pan-European ANSPs. The ACE benchmarking analysis also informs ATM stakeholders on the level and trends of the Pan-European system cost-effectiveness performance.

-   The en‐route cost‐efficiency KPI (the Determined Unit Cost or DUC), which is defined in the Performance Scheme regulation, is used as part of the SES cost‐efficiency performance target‐setting and monitoring processes. This KPI is computed as the ratio of en‐route ANS costs (in real terms) to service units at charging zone level, and reflects the costs of several entities, not only the ANSP. The en-route ANS costs (in nominal terms) and service units also form the basis to calculate the unit rate that is billed to airspace users within a charging zone.

The ACE benchmarking reports complement the SES target setting and monitoring activities by providing a detailed comparison of cost-effectiveness performance at ANSP level including a trend analysis of three main economic drivers (productivity, employment costs and support costs).

As shown in @fig-indicator-and-kpi, the main differences between the ACE financial cost-effectiveness indicator and the SES en-route cost-efficiency KPI are the following:

-   **Operational scope**: En-route and terminal costs are considered  together when benchmarking the economic performance of ANSPs in  the ACE analysis. It is important to consider a "gate-to-gate"  perspective because the boundaries used to allocate costs between  en-route and terminal ANS vary between ANSPs and might introduce a  bias in the cost-effectiveness analysis. On the other hand, the  SES cost-efficiency KPI is computed for en-route and terminal ANS  separately, for the purposes of the target-setting and/or  monitoring processes.

-   **Service scope**: Total ANS costs (including costs relating to the  ANSPs, METSPs, EUROCONTROL, and NSAs) are used to compute the SES  cost-efficiency KPI, while only the ANSPs ATM/CNS provision costs  are included in the ACE benchmarking analysis.

-   **Measure of the output**: The output metric used to compute the SES  en-route cost-efficiency KPI is the number of en-route service  units[^5]. This metric is a function of the aircraft weight and of  the distance flown within a given charging zone. This is the  metric which has been historically used to compute the en-route  unit rate charged to airspace users. On the other hand, the ACE  financial cost-effectiveness indicator is computed using composite  flight-hours, which combine both flight-hours and IFR airport  movements (see @sec-metric-and-framework). It should be noted that the  geographical area controlled by ANSPs operational units can  substantially differ from the charging zones in case of delegation  of ANS. The composite flight-hours therefore better reflect the  operational activity performed by ANSPs, while service units are  more appropriate when charging zones are considered.
