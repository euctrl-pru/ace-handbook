  abstract = {This note presents the methodology used to measure the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). Several inputs and outputs are defined and selected for the purposes of computing multilateral output and input indexes associated with the provision of ATM/CNS. TFP scores and TFP growth rates are computed for the European system and for each ANSP using a panel of 29 ANSPs and three years (2001-2002-2003) derived from the ATM Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) data set. A sensitivity analysis of TFP scores suggests that TFP levels are fairly stable and not too sensitives to the various hypotheses considered. Finally, a regression analysis is performed to identify the impact of selected exogenous factors (e.g. airspace density, traffic variability) on TFP scores.},

It is a revision of the EUROCONTROL Specification Version 2.1 which was originally mandated in 2001 by the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission Decision No 88. The information collected is used to analyse and compare performance across ANSPs (benchmarking) and over time and supports the production of regular reports on ANSPs cost-efficiency performance. This information and derived analysis are also key elements in the effective implementation of the Single European Sky Performance Scheme, including EU-wide target setting, assessment of performance plans and annual monitoring.},
