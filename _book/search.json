It also analyses changes in ATM/CNS cost-effectiveness performance over the past 5 years and presents forward-looking information for the next 5 years. A particular focus is put on the three main economic drivers of cost-effectiveness (productivity, employment costs and support costs).\nThe ACE handbook (this document) provides general information on the scope of the analysis, outlines the processes involved in the production of the report, and includes explanations on the factors affecting performance and indicators used in the ACE benchmarking analysis.\nANSP factsheets and individual ANSP short reports (previously Part II of the ACE reports) are now only published on the web.\n\nThe ACE Dashboard provides interactive functionalities that allow users to design and customise original analyses and presentations based on ACE data (starting with 2002 data and updated annually).\nDigital versions of all the documents listed above as well as the ACE dashboard can be accessed at the following address: https://ansperformance.eu/economics/ace-overview/",

    "text": "3.1 Composite output metric and framework for cost-effectiveness performance analysis\nThe output measures for ANS provision are, for en-route, the en-route flight-hours controlled1 and, for terminal ANS, the number of IFR airport movements controlled. In addition to those output metrics, it is important to consider a “gate-to-gate” perspective, because the boundaries used to allocate costs between en-route and terminal ANS vary between ANSPs and might introduce a bias in the cost-effectiveness analysis.\nFor this reason, an indicator combining the two separate output measures for en-route and terminal ANS provision has been calculated. The “composite gate-to-gate flight-hours” are determined by weighting the output measures by their respective average cost of the service for the whole Pan-European system.\nThis average weighting factor is based on the total monetary value of the outputs over a period starting in 2002 and ending in the year under review. The weighting factor can therefore vary marginally each time new costs and traffic data are added to the ACE database. As an indication, the value of the weighting factor based on the ACE 2023 data was around 0.28. However, composite flight-hours are calculated without rounding this factor. ANSPs wishing to calculate the exact value of their composite flight-hours can contact the PRU to get the exact figure, without rounding.\nThe composite gate-to-gate flight-hours are consequently defined as:\n\\[ \\textrm{Composite gate-to-gate flight-hours} = \\textrm{En-route flight-hours} + (0.28 * \\textrm{IFR airport movements}) \\]\nIn the ACE 2001-2006 Reports (Performance Review Unit 2023), two different weighting factors were used to compute ANSPs cost-effectiveness: one for the year under study and another to examine changes in performance across time. As the ACE data sample became larger in terms of years, the difference between these two weighting factors became insignificant. For the sake of simplicity, it was therefore proposed in the ACE 2007 benchmarking report to use only one weighting factor to analyse ANSPs performance for the year and to examine historical changes in cost-effectiveness.\nAlthough the composite gate-to-gate output metric does not fully reflect all aspects of the complexity of the services provided, it is nevertheless the best metric currently available for the analysis of gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness2.\nFor the sake of completeness, the gate-to-gate financial cost-effectiveness indicator is broken down into en-route and terminal components, with the output units being en-route flight-hours and IFR airport movements, respectively. There are cases where a high en-route cost per flight-hour correspond to a low terminal cost per IFR airport movement and vice versa.\nThe PRU has developed an analytical framework that allows cost-effectiveness to be broken down into a number of key components. This framework helps in understanding differences in cost-effectiveness by allowing examination of the detailed factors underlying it. It is important to note that the focus of the ACE analysis is on the ATM/CNS provision costs incurred by the ANSP. MET costs, EUROCONTROL costs and States/NSAs costs are not included as not always under the ANSPs direct management control.\nThe right-hand side of the Figure 3.1 shows that the financial cost-effectiveness indicator (ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight-hour) is made up of three component performance ratios:\nThese three ratios multiplied together give the overall financial cost-effectiveness KPI.\nThe financial cost-effectiveness indicator can also be broken down into two additive factors:\nThe latter indicator is preferred to the support cost ratio for two main reasons. First, the support cost ratio cannot be viewed in isolation since a low ratio may simply be a symptom of high ATCO employment costs. Second, given that there are fixed costs in the provision of ATM/CNS (such as infrastructure and ATM systems), “support costs per unit of output” can give additional insights into the analysis of support costs and scale effects.",

    "text": "3.2 Further methodological considerations on ATCO-hour productivity\nThe metric of ATCO-hour productivity used in the ACE report is measured as the ratio between composite flight-hours and ATCO in OPS hours on duty. It reflects the average productivity during a year for a given ANSP and does not give an indication of the productivity at peak times which can be substantially higher.\nLarge differences in ATCO-hour productivity are observed in the ACE analyses. These differences should not be seen in isolation, but together with other indicators such as ATCO employment costs and unit support costs. In addition, many factors contribute to the observed differences in ATCO-hour productivity. Some of these factors can be associated with operational conditions (such as traffic complexity and variability, the type of airspace under the ANSP responsibility or the number of airports operated by the ANSP potentially including low traffic tower operational units), legal and socio-economic conditions (e.g. general labour laws) and institutional issues (e.g. regulatory aspects and governance arrangements).\nOther factors as yet unidentified (and not measured) such as the impact of different operational concepts and processes, the operational flexibility, could also affect ATCO productivity performance. There may also be cultural and managerial differences. These elements would deserve additional analysis in order to provide further insight on the differences in ATCO productivity and identify best practices.\nChanges in ATCOs in OPS hours on duty could arise from:\n\nChanges in the number of FTE ATCOs in OPS (caused by such factors as newly licensed ATCOs, normal retirement, activation of an early retirement scheme);\nChanges in the number of hours on duty, through:\n\nModification of the contractual working hours following a new labour agreement;\nChanges in the number of hours not on duty (for example, through an increase in average sickness or in refresher training time); or,\nChanges in overtime (where applicable).\n\n\nIn the context of the yearly benchmarking activity, the ACE reports analyse ANSPs’ productivity, both in terms of a cross-section analysis for the year under review and in terms of time series (usually a six-year period). This medium-term perspective is particularly useful for observing changes over time, given the specific characteristics of the ANS industry, which usually requires a certain lead-time to develop ATM systems and infrastructure.\nImprovements in ATCO-hour productivity can result from more effective OPS room management and by making a better use of existing resources, for example through the adaptation of rosters (preferably individually-based to enhance flexibility) and shift times, effective management of overtime, and through the adaptation of sector opening times to traffic demand patterns. Similarly, advanced ATM system functionalities and procedures are drivers for productivity improvements.\nOn the other hand, it is clear that some of the measures implemented by an ANSP to provide extra capacity can have a negative impact on its ATCO-hour productivity performance. This is, for example, the case of a sector split which will allow the ANSP to create additional capacity in its airspace at the expense of more ATCOs or ATCO-hours on duty required to man the additional sector(s).",

    "text": "3.3 Further methodological considerations on support costs\nContrary to ATCO employment costs, support costs encompass a variety of cost items which require specific analysis. There is a general acknowledgement that the Pan-European system has excessive support costs due to its high level of operational, organisational, technical and regulatory fragmentation.\nSupport costs can be broken down into four separate components that provide further insight into the nature of support costs:\n\nEmployment costs for non-ATCO in OPS staff; these cover ATCOs on other duties, trainees, technical support and administrative staff. These costs can be affected by the following factors:\n\n\nOutsourcing of non-core activities (such as maintenance of technical equipment, and professional training) could transfer costs from this category to non-staff costs.\nResearch & development policies may involve ATM systems either being developed in-house, or purchased off-the-shelf. In principle, either solution could lead to the most cost-effective outcome, depending on circumstances; this would depend on whether there were, for example, significant economies of scale, or major transaction costs.\nArrangements relating to the collective agreement and the pension scheme for non-ATCOs in OPS.\n\n\nNon-staff operating costs mostly comprise expenses for energy, communications, contracted services, rentals, insurance, and taxes. These costs can be affected by the following factors:\n\n\nThe terms and conditions of contracts for outsourced activities.\nEnhancement of the cooperation with other ANSPs to achieve synergies (sharing training of ATCOs, joint maintenance, and other matters).\n\n\nCapital-related costs comprising depreciation and financing costs for the capital employed. These costs can be affected by the following factors:\n\n\nThe magnitude of the investment programme.\nThe accounting life of the assets.\nThe degree to which assets are owned or rented.\n\n\nExceptional costs, which typically represent a very small proportion of support costs.\n\nThere are significant differences in the composition of support costs amongst the 38 ANSPs, and in particular in the proportion of employment costs and non-staff operating costs. The choice between providing some important operational support functions internally or externally has clearly an impact on the proportion of support costs that is classified as employment costs, non-staff operating costs, or capital-related costs. In some cases, the maintenance of ATM systems is outsourced and the corresponding costs are reported as non-staff operating costs. For other ANSPs, these activities are rather carried out by internal staff and the related costs appear as employment costs or as capital-related costs when, according to IFRS, the employment costs of staff working on R&D projects can be capitalised in the balance-sheet.\nEmployment costs are typically subject to complex bargaining agreements between ANSPs management and staff which usually are embedded into a collective agreement. The duration of the collective agreement, the terms and methods for renegotiation greatly vary across ANSPs. In some cases salary conditions are negotiated every year. High ATCO employment costs may be compensated for by high productivity. Therefore, in the context of staff planning and contract renegotiation, it is important for ANSPs to manage ATCOs employment costs effectively and to set quantitative objectives for ATCO productivity while providing sufficient capacity in order to minimise ATFM delays.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Review Commission. 2005. “Total Factor Productivity of European Air Navigation Services Providers: Basic Concepts and Empirical Application.” {{PRU Technical Note}} 01/2005.

In the ACE benchmarking reports, an indicator of “economic” cost-effectiveness is computed at ANSP and Pan-European system levels by adding the ATM/CNS provision costs and the costs of ATFM ground delay, all expressed per composite flight-hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Framework for economic cost-effectiveness performance analysis\n\n\n\nATFM delays used in the ACE analysis are extracted from the Network Manager database. All delay causes (e.g. capacity, weather, etc.) are considered.\nOnly airports where the ANSPs are responsible to provide ATC services are taken into account when aggregating airport delays at ANSP level. This is verified each year during the ACE data validation process. Airport ATFM delays also include departure delays.\nATFM delays are calculated after post-ops and eNM adjustments, which entails a re-allocation of ATFM delays across ACCs in order to account for the initiatives taken to improve performance at network level. This process was initially launched in 2016 but the magnitude of ATFM delay reallocation became really significant in 2018 and 2019 due to the large extent of the measures implemented by the NM. In order to have consistent time series within the ACE report, the adjusted ATFM delays are used retroactively starting from 2016.\nDelays are taken into account independently of their duration. There is no distinction between delays lower or higher than 15 minutes.\nThe cost of ATFM delay in this report is based on the European airline delay cost reference values, published by the University of Westminster (University of Westminster 2015).

    "section": "5.2 Exogenous factors",
    "text": "5.2 Exogenous factors\nExogenous factors arise from the basic conditions in which an ANSP operates, which can differ from one country to another. Exogenous factors are likely to influence the way ANSPs organise and conduct their business. In some cases they may also affect the way an ANSP manages costs and determines the level of charges.\nExogenous factors cover a spectrum of observability and measurability. At one extreme, the impact of irrecoverable VAT on inputs, which differs from state to state, is readily quantified. It has a direct impact on apparent performance which can be perfectly adjusted for. At an intermediate level there are factors for which it is possible to derive metrics (examples are traffic complexity, market wage rates, and exchange rate volatility), but it is difficult to specify exactly how such factors might affect performance. Even more difficult to take into account are factors such as political influence (and interference) on ANS provision. Finally, there will inevitably be exogenous factors that are simply impossible to identify, although they are no less real than the other factors discussed.\nIn Figure 5.1, exogenous factors that could have an impact on performance have been classified into two main areas (top and central set of factors in Figure 5.1), according to which set of decision-makers have an influence over them. The top set, comprising legal and socio-economic conditions, and operational conditions, are affected by decision makers and conditions outside aviation policy-making. The central set, comprising institutional and governance arrangements, are exogenous to the ANSP but are influenced by aviation sector policy decisions.\nExogenous factors need, as far as possible to be taken into account both in achieving fair benchmarking, and in effective target setting:\n\nLocal differences in exogenous factors can either create a direct advantage or a direct burden on performance;\nLocal institutional and governance arrangements may have been set with the specific purpose of creating incentives to follow performance-driven strategies.\n\nCapturing the local impact of an exogenous factor on ANSPs performance is not a straightforward exercise. First, there is no guarantee that a given exogenous factor will affect all ANSPs in the same manner. It is possible that similar conditions could create effects working in opposite direction (bringing both benefits and difficulties). Second, similar exogenous factors may not necessarily affect different ANSPs to the same degree, either because of endogenous factors relating to how an issue is managed, or by other exogenous factors constraining an ANSP’s response. So a given factor might create a small burden in one ANSP, while affecting another more seriously.\nThe legal and socio-economic conditions prevailing in individual countries are affected by national policy-makers at a more general level (for example taxation policy), or by national and international macro-economic conditions. Major examples include the prevailing national wage rates, and levels and systems of taxation.\nSome examples that affect ATM cost-effectiveness performance are illustrated in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Legal & socio-economic conditions\n\n\n\nThe operational conditions, such as the traffic patterns the ANSP has to deal with, are determined by decisions made by airports, airlines, and especially, flying travellers.\nOperational conditions include a number of factors, summarised in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Operational conditions\n\n\n\nOperational conditions undoubtedly have a direct impact on cost-effectiveness performance, although the extent and magnitude of the impact is not straightforward to isolate.\nThe institutional and governance arrangements for ANS in a particular country are set in place by the policies and specific aviation laws of each country. These factors are exogenous to the ANSP but decision-making concerning some of them is largely driven by national aviation policy-makers. Some of these factors relate to international requirements such as those imposed by ICAO, EUROCONTROL and the Single European Sky. These policies at State and European level are subject to changes given strategic objectives for the sector.\nFigure 5.4 provides a list of such factors, relating to:\n\nthe way ANS is regulated;\nthe institutional structure surrounding ANS, the ANSP ownership and control structure; and\nthe civil/military arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Institutional & governance arrangements\n\n\n\nIt is generally considered that institutional and governance arrangements will not affect ATM cost-effectiveness directly; rather they act as influences or constraints affecting endogenous factors (such as the overall business objectives, the internal organisation, and the operational setup between civil and military).",

    "text": "5.3 Endogenous factors\nIn principle, once the impact of all exogenous factors has been allowed for, the performance differences that remain should comprise residual inefficiency which lowers performance below that obtained by best practice. Such residual inefficiency arises from a number of endogenous factors, under the direct control of ANSPs.\nA better understanding of the endogenous factors would enable some progress in the analysis of benchmarking results, in the identification of best practices, and in the process of target setting.\nEndogenous factors – the way that an ANSP manages its business to optimise performance – are influenced by exogenous factors. “Best practice” in any given area will depend on the exogenous circumstances. ANSPs can take action to fully exploit the benefit of their environment or to minimize the impact of relative disadvantages. Therefore, the impact of an exogenous factor should not be analysed in isolation from an analysis of the degree to which this impact has been minimised or maximized through appropriate internal measures.\nDifferent data and methodologies from those currently used in the ACE Benchmarking Report would be required to investigate endogenous factors in more depth. Clearly, it is the responsibility of the ANSP to determine how best to respond to the local conditions.\nEndogenous factors fall into three groups:\n\norganisational factors;\nmanagerial and financial aspects; and,\noperational and technical setup.\n\nFigure 5.5 lists the factors that would need to be considered in the scope of a comprehensive analysis of the impact of ANSP organisation on performance. They mainly relate to four issues which are typically addressed in the Balanced Scorecard methodology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Organisational factors\n\n\n\nThese issues are:\n\nThe internal organisation structure;\nThe degree to which assets and activities are retained in-house;\n\nHuman resources; and\n\nRelationship with customer.\n\nNot all organisational factors will directly affect cost-effectiveness; some enable or facilitate the achievement of performance when they are set in conformity with the business objectives. It is likely that no single model should constitute “best practice” in all circumstances.\nFigure 5.6 provides a list of factors that would need to be considered in the scope of a comprehensive examination of the influence of ANSP managerial and financial arrangements on performance. They mainly relate to the following three issues:\n\nThe quality of management;\nThe collective bargaining process; and\nFinancial and accounting considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Managerial & financial aspects\n\n\n\nMost of the managerial and financial aspects are expected to directly affect cost-effectiveness, since they have an impact, for example, on investment decisions, productivity and wage policies. The managerial and financial aspects are to some extent influenced by the ANSP organisational factors and by some of the exogenous factors (especially among the institutional and governance factors, and among the socio-economic factors).\nFigure 5.7 provides a list of factors that would need to be considered in a comprehensive examination of the influence of ANSP operational and technical setup on performance. They mainly relate to the following three issues:\n\nOperational structure;\nOperational concepts and processes; and\nOperational flexibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Operational & technical setup\n\n\n\nThe operational and technical setup of an ANSP is expected to be influenced by both exogenous factors (typically the operational environment) and other endogenous factors (such as internal organisation and investment policy). The operational and technical setup is expected to affect both labour and capital productivity and the level of support costs.",

    "text": "Presentation and comparison of historical series of financial data from different countries poses problems, especially when different currencies are involved, and inflation rates differ. There is a danger that time-series comparisons can be distorted by transient variations in exchange rates.\nFor this reason, the following approach has been adopted in the analysis for allowing for inflation and exchange rate variation. The financial elements of performance are assessed, for each year, in national currency. They are then converted to national currency in year-N prices using national inflation rates. Finally, for comparison purposes in year-N, all national currencies are converted to Euros using the year-N exchange rate.\nThis approach has the virtue that an ANSP’s performance time series is not distorted by transient changes in exchange rates over the period. It does mean, however, that the performance figures for any ANSP in a given year prior to year-N are not the same as the figures in that year’s ACE report, and cannot legitimately be compared with another ANSP’s figures for the same year. Cross-sectional comparison using the figures in the ACE analytical report is only appropriate for year-N data.\nThe exchange rates used to convert the year-N data in Euros are those provided by the ANSPs in their ACE data submission.\nThe historical inflation figures used in ACE are obtained from EUROSTAT or from the International Monetary Fund when the information is not available in EUROSTAT website. For the projections (future years), the ANSPs’ own assumptions concerning inflation rates are used.\nEmployment costs constitute a major part of ANS provision costs. Staff has to be recruited in local labour markets, and therefore the prevailing wage rates, for many different grades and types of staff, will have a major influence on the overall employment costs. There are a number of ways of measuring differences in prevailing wage levels between different countries. In the ACE benchmarking reports, unit employment costs are also compared when adjusted for Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs). Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are currency conversion rates that are applied to convert economic indicators in national currency to an artificial common currency (Purchasing Power Standard (PPS) for EUROSTAT statistics). The PPPs data used to adjust most of the ANSPs employment costs is extracted from EUROSTAT.\nFor four countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), PPP data is not available in the EUROSTAT database. In these cases, the IMF database is used. Since in the IMF database, the PPPs are expressed in local currency per international Dollar rather than PPS, an adjustment is made so that the figures used for ARMATS, Sakaeronavigatsia, MOLDATSA and UkSATSE are as consistent as possible with the data used for the rest of the ANSPs. The assumption underlying this adjustment is that the difference in PPPs between two countries shall be the same in the EUROSTAT and in the IMF databases.\nThere are some limitations1 inherent to the use of PPPs and for this reason the ACE data analysis does not put a significant weight on results obtained with PPPs adjustments. PPPs are nevertheless a useful analytical tool in the context of international benchmarking.",
